# yo, just trying to improve bro ðŸ”¥

im just trying to improve, bro. being conscious about this whole thing and pursuing greatness no matter what. this is where i dump all my leetcode progress and probably complain about hard problems lol.

## why this exists

look, i could lie and say this is some super organized professional thing, but honestly? im just trying to get better at coding and not be trash at interviews. every problem i solve here is me pushing through the frustration and actually learning something.

im pursuing greatness no matter what - sounds dramatic but that's literally the mindset. small wins, daily grind, all that good stuff.

## current status

```
problems solved: 0 (gotta start somewhere)
current streak: 0 days (ouch)
easy: 0 | medium: 0 | hard: 0
```

## the plan

- solve stuff daily (or at least try to)
- document what i learn so i dont forget
- get good enough for interviews
- maybe help other people who are struggling too

## languages im using

- javascript/typescript (main ones, love the ecosystem)
- python (when i feel like it)
- java (maybe for interviews)
- honestly whatever i want to try - rust? go? why not

## real talk

this is gonna be messy sometimes. im learning, making mistakes, and probably overthinking stuff. but that's the point - im trying to get better every day.

some days ill solve 3 problems, other days ill stare at one problem for hours. both are valid. progress isnt always linear and im cool with that.

## if you're here

maybe you're going through the same thing? struggling with algorithms? feeling like everyone else is better? same bro, same. 

if anything here helps you, thats awesome. if you have suggestions or want to share your own journey, hit me up.

*"im not trying to be perfect, im trying to be better"*
